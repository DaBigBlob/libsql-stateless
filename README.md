# libsql-stateless

> Thin libSQL stateless HTTP driver for TypeScript and JavaScript for the edge üöÄ
- ‚úÖ **Supported runtime environments:** Web API (browser, serverless), Bun, Node.js (>=18)
- ‚úÖ **Extremely thin:** Has no dependency, only has a few functions that implement the [`Hrana v3 HTTP`](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/libsql-server/docs/HRANA_3_SPEC.md) protocol from scratch, and has no classes (tend to duplicate memory and/or perform long memory traversals).
- ‚úÖ **Does no extra computation.**
- ‚úÖ **Has no premature optimizations.**
- ‚úÖ Unlike `@libsql/client/web`, **every function performs complete execution in exactly 1 roundtrip.**
- ‚úÖ **Is built for:** Quick stateless query execution. (Mainly for serverless and edge functions.)
- ‚úÖ **Supports everything in** `@libsql/client/web`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Interactive transactions are not supported** because this lib is stateless but [`transactions`](https://github.com/DaBigBlob/libsql-stateless/wiki/transactions) are supported.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **The API provided by `libsql-stateless` is raw and explicit** for reducing (computational and memory) overheads.

**For easier DX, consider using [`libsql-stateless-easy`](https://github.com/DaBigBlob/libsql-stateless-easy) instead**: it, however, comes with the cost of non-zero-dependency and (computational and memory) overheads potentially unneeded by you. But is still very very very slim compared to `@libsql/client`.

# Why not just use `@libsql/client/web`?
1. Not everyone needs stateful DB connection or the overheads that come with it.
2. To provide a simpler API, `@libsql/client/web` does a lot of, I'd argue unnecessary, computation under the hood.\
    Many people would rather use a more complex API than have worse performance.

# Installation

# TODO
- Switch to protobuf from json? (not really needed if not reading thousands of rows/s)
